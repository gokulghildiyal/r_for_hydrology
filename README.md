# r_for_hydrology
R-code for hydrology and statistics
These are code we use generally in hydrological studies such as linear regression, timeseries analysis of various hydrometereological parameters, models such as SPEI and others.
These files can directly be used in R you just need to provide your csv file location and change your values name as u have put it in your csv files.
You can then directly run these files without any problems.
Feel free to ask any question related to usage. I'll be happy to help.
